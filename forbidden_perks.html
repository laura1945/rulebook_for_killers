            <h2>Devour Hope</h2>
            <div>Talk about getting carried by overpowered perks. Does one even require any skill to "win" with this? After five hooks, survivors can be eliminated from the game through mori even if they have never been hooked before. The only goodside is that it prevents camping. But if the killer was actually good, they would not need to camp in the first place.</div>

            <h2>No One Escapes Death</h2>
            <div>This perk punishes survivors for finishing all the generators because the killer did not know how to pressure the map effectively.</div>
