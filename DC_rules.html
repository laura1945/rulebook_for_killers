            When a survivor disconnects early on in the game, especially when there are more than 3 generators left, the killer should farm. At this point, the survivors are at a major disadvantage, and it is not a huge accomplishment to win against this weakened team. Any decent killer who is not a sweaty try hard would just farm. I've even had a nice Nemesis who disconnected after he realized the only other survivor could not rescue me from the hook because they went AFK. He sacrificed his own bloodpoints, rank, and survivor pudding offering so that I wouldn't get saccrificed.
