        Whether it's face camping or proxy camping, it is toxic. It ruins the fun for everyone because it doesn't give the survivors a chance to safely unhook their teammates. Additionally, all while the killer camps, the other survivors are getting generators done uninterrupted. Therefore, it isn't even a good strategy for the killer in the long run.

        Tunneling usually goes hand in hand with camping. Again, it ruins the fun for everyone. If a survivor unhooks someone right in front of the killer, the killer should go for the person who did the unhooking because it is not the unhooked survivor's fault for the bad unhooking. Also, if the survivors tend to perform unsafe unhooks, then they might have borrowed time. This is another strong reason to not tunnel the recently unhooked survivors. To add on, some survivors may have decisive strike to counter tunneling.

    <div class="paragraph_format top_margin">
        The only time camping or tunneling is reasonable is when all the generators are done and the killer still doesn't have any sacrifices. In this situation, camping or tunneling is okay because the survivors understand that the killer wants to guarantee at least one sacrifice. In any other situation, however, camping or tunneling someone is rude.
